 Selection Class: 
 This class implements the selection phase of the MCTS 
 In MCTS, each node represents a game state. During the selection phase, we traverse the tree from the root to find a node that is:
 - not fully expanded (still has unexplored moves), or
 - a terminal node (game over)
 
 Selection uses the UCT formula (The one that Jan explained in the first meeting):
 UCT = (w_i / n_i) + C * sqrt( ln(N) / n_i )
Where:
 - w_i: number of wins for the child
  - n_i: number of visits for the child
 - N: number of visits for the parent node
 - C: exploration constant (balances exploration vs exploitation)
 */

    // sqrt(2) is commonly used to balance exploration and exploitation.
    private double c = Math.sqrt(2); 
    
    /*
    Main Selection Method
    Goes through the tree from the given node until we reach a node that:
    - is not fully expanded (has untried moves)
    - or is terminal (end of game) -> as explained previously
